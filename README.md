# todoList
This is the Todo-List website, where one can add/delete/edit tasks. 
Moreover, it is possible to set preferrable theme (dark/light) by clicking the switch button on the top.
After clicking the "Save Button," all of the user's inputs (task operations + theme choice) will be stored in the localStorage.
